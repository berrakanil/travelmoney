Basic RESTful Currency Converter with Java

This is a sample project to get familiar with Java, Spring, REST, JUnit, Mockito technologies and frameworks. It was developed using Test-Driven Development.

travelmoney will give you the currency conversion rate for a currency pair you provide in JSON format. It is a RESTful web service that retrieves rates using Yahoo! YQL. 

Example usage is:

`http://localhost:8080/rate?pair=EURUSD`



###### TODO
- Add support to convert an amount given to a target currency. 
- Add an error page request handler
